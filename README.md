Erduite is a mobile application designed to make English language learning engaging and accessible. Developed using Android Studio, the app combines interactive lessons, quizzes, and real-world examples to help users improve their vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. This is a basic iteration of the app built to test my ability to work on the project day and night. I built this using the tools that required what we now call "vibe coding" - I think before the term was even invented. This app was built in December 2023 using the tools of that era (including ChatGPT-3.5), thus showcasing my ability to take up new technologies and my agility to switch to newer stacks to level up my productivity, as proven.
